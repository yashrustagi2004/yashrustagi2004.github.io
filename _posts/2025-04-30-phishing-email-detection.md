# Kingfisher 

# Introduction

Phishing emails are cybersecurity threats that can trick users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, financial details, or personal data. Traditional rule-based detection methods struggle with evolving phishing tactics. 

Kingfisher is our proposed solution for real-time detection of phishing attempts made through emails. It is a Chrome Extension for detection of phishing emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
